     This is a fork from Claes Jakobsson's perl JavaScript module.
     Although almost every area was revamped, we try hard to be fully backward
     compatible, but you should read the documentation.

     The following are the most visible changes:

    - All that you cat expect to be passed by reference between both
      interpreters are now not "converted" but passed encapsulated in
      specialized classes and are "alive".
    - All Perl classes are exportable to JavaScript. Think (mouth-watering):

	var DBI = Sys.require('DBI');
	var handler = DBI.connect(...);

    - New "questions free" building mechanism.
    - Builds against SpiderMonkey 1.7.0 up to (unreleased) 1.8.5 as found in
      Gecko 1.9.3.
    - Improved exception handling.
    - Perl can access and manipulate JavaScript's 'this'.
    - Full support for utf8 even when SpiderMonkey wasn't compiled with support
      for it.
    - The code is modularized, some subsystems are only loaded on demand.
    - A command line 'jspl' JavaScript shell included for standalone apps execution.
    - Much bigger test battery. Grown from 311 to over 900 tests. 
    - Revised and extender documentation.
    - Many bugs fixed.
