=head1 NAME

PerlScalar - Encapsulate Perl SCALAR references in JavaScript

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The ability to take references to stuff in perl is a basic language feature
used by many perl modules. As such, it's important to be able to pass to
javascript references to perl scalars and to create in javascript references to
scalars.

=head1 JAVASCRIPT INTERFACE

Any I<unblessed> SCALAR reference that you pass from perl to javascrip will be
wrapped as an instance of C<PerlScalar>, Blessed ones will be normally a L<PerlObject>.

=head2 Contructor

You can construct from javascript new SCALAR references.

=over 4

=item new PerlScalar(somevalue)

    var ref = new PerlScalar(mystr);

Creates a perl scalar with a copy of I<somevalue> and returns a new reference to it.
If you pass this object to perl land it will be undistinguishable from a normal
reference. C<somevalue> can be any javascript primitive value.
