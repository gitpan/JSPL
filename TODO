We plan the following road-map for JSPL 1.x, in no particular order:

- Test building in more platforms.
- API to move Objects between contexts
- Extend security model
- Write a small tutorial for javascript users about using CPAN modules.
- Write more examples
- Complete separation of "engine" vs "glue" code, to allow a SM based bootstrap
- Complete documentation.
- Testing, testing and Testing.
